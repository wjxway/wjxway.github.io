## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Major Research Projects

#### Development of Single Motor Drone Swarm System  
*Fall 2021 – Present*  
This research demonstrates the first single motor drone swarm capable of autonomous flight using peer-to-peer (P2P) communication and sensing. Each drone, weighing only 20g and containing just one moving part, can fly independently with full control, featuring onboard P2P communication and precise positioning enabled by a novel infrared-based system. The drone is 10x lighter than all previous systems with comparable P2P positioning accuracy. I am the only student on this project and carried out:
- Kalman filter based state estimator + LQR based flight controller design.
- Sensitive (100nA), high-speed (10Mbps) free-space IR communication circuit design.
- Relative position sensing mechanism design (concept from my advisor, Prof. Rubenstein).
- PCB and structural design.
- Custom and mission-specific communication protocol design and its implementation on Lattice FPGA.
- Embedded software development on ESP32-S3 platform.
- Swarm localization and sensing algorithm design.

#### Development of Single Motor Spherical Robot  
*Fall 2023 – Present*  
This research presents the first single motor spherical robot, Rollbot, and its control strategy. Rollbot minimizes mechanical complexity and cost and can be used as fail-safe strategy for conventional spherical robots in the case of motor failures. My role in this project includes:
- Came up with the concept of underactuated spherical robot.
- Independently developed the analytical equation and quasi-stable approximation.
- Independently developed the hardware and feedback control algorithm.
- Collaboratively developing the RL-based control algorithm for better agility.

#### Development of Reconfigurable Legged Metamachine  
*Spring 2024 – Present*  
This research introduces autonomous modular legs: agile yet minimal, single-degree-of-freedom jointed links that can learn complex dynamic behaviors and may be freely attached to form legged metamachines at the meter scale. This research enables rapid repair, redesign, and recombination of highly dynamic modular agents that move quickly and acrobatically through unstructured environments. My role includes:
- Lead development of the docking mechanism and electrical and mechanical hardware.
- Helped with development of RL-based metamachine control algorithm.
- Collaboratively developing the next generation, self-reconfigurable legged metamachine.

#### Development of Underwater Localization System Based on Electrostatic Field  
*Fall 2020 – Fall 2022*  
This research proposed a bio-mimetic method to use electrostatic field for P2P localization and communication, which has benefits in size and cost compared to sonar-based solutions. My role includes:
- Developed the theory and algorithm for 6-DoF underwater localization using electrostatic field.
- Developed the hardware for high sensitivity (1µV), high dynamic range (10⁶) underwater signal capture.
